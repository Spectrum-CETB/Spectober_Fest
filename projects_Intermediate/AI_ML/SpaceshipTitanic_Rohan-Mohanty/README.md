## Tech Stack
Python , Machine Learning

## Description
The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.
To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system.

Approach - I first did Eda to know more about the features and then did a bit of Feature Enginerring for training the model . Then I used Logistic Regression , Descision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier from which Random Forest was giving the most Accuracy
