## HOSTED IN NETLIFY [ProjectLink](https://primefactorcalc.netlify.app/)
## Description :
Made a Prime factor calculator app using **Sieve of Eratosthenes** to calculate prime factors in **O(n log log n)** time complexity assuming worst case scenario. User input would be taken and factors would be calculated.

**Major concepts:-**
Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
Dom manipulation
User input sanitisation

## Salient Features:-
- can calculate upto **1,00,00,000** numbers instantly through **pre-computation**
- factors are presented in three forms:- **prime factors, factorization and factorization with exponents**.
- modified version of **Sieve of Eratosthenes** is used to make calculation much more faster.
- clean UI with mobile responsiveness.

### Tech Stack :-  Vanilla Javascript, CSS, HTML5
