# ANAGRAMS
 Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

# Problem Explanation ðŸš€
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# My logic ðŸ¤¯
My approach was to input the string, make it a list of strings, sort them and then compare them.
 
 TEST CASES:
 1. Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
    Output: TRUE

 2. Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
    Output: FALSE

Time Complexity -> O(1)
