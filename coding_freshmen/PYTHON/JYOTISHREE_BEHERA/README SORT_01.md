# SORT_01
You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order.

# Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array [Basically you have to sort the array]. 

# My logic ðŸ¤¯
My approach was to input an array of 1's and 0's and simply sort them using the sort function.
 
 TEST CASES:
 1. input: [1,0,1]
    output: [0,1,1]

 2. input: [1,1,0,1,0]
    output: [0,0,1,1,1]

# Time Complexity and Space Complexity
```python

Time Complexity -> O(1)
Space Complexity -> O(1)

```
