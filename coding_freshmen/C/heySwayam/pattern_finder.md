Pattern Finder

# Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Given a text txt[0. . .n-1] and a pattern pat[0. . .m-1].

Write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]..

# Your logic ðŸ¤¯
* Approach: Created two arrays to hold the two strings and compared the array one by one and get the index
* Own test cases if any
* Code Structure and Libraries used

# Time Complexity and Space Complexity
```cpp
Example 

Time Complexity -> O(n^2)
Space Complexity -> O(1)

```
