# <Title of the Problem>
Sort_1

# Problem Explanation ðŸš€
You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order.

Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array [Basically you have to sort the array]. 

Input array   =  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] 

Output array =  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

# Your logic ðŸ¤¯
* Approach: Compared each element of the array with the rest of the elements and sorted accordingly
* Own test cases if any
* Code Structure and Libraries used

# Time Complexity and Space Complexity
```cpp
Example 

Time Complexity -> O(n^2)
Space Complexity -> O(1)

```
