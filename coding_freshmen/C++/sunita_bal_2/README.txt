1. Rat in a Maze Problem - I

Consider a rat placed at (0, 0) in a square matrix of order N * N. It has to reach the destination at (N - 1, N - 1). Find all possible paths that the rat can take to reach from source to destination. The directions in which the rat can move are 'U'(up), 'D'(down), 'L' (left), 'R' (right). Value 0 at a cell in the matrix represents that it is blocked and rat cannot move to it while value 1 at a cell in the matrix represents that rat can be travel through it.
Note: In a path, no cell can be visited more than one time. If the source cell is 0, the rat cannot move to any other cell.

Problem Explanation:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function printPath() which takes N and 2D array m[ ][ ] as input parameters and returns the list of paths in lexicographically increasing order. 
Note: In case of no path, return an empty list. The driver will output "-1" automatically.

Time Complexity:
Time Complexity: O((3N^2)).
Auxiliary Space: O(L * X), L = length of the path, X = number of paths.

2. The Celebrity Problem

A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
A square NxN matrix M[][] is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. Here M[i][i] will always be 0.
Note: Follow 0 based indexing.

Problem Explanation:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function celebrity() which takes the matrix M and its size N as input parameters and returns the index of the celebrity. If no such celebrity is present, return -1.

Time Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(N^2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
