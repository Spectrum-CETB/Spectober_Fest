# MAJORITY__ELEMENT
We are given an array of size n and we have to return a Majority element .
# Problem Explanation 🚀

here we have to return the Majority element that is the  array element that ocurrs more than n/2 times

# Your logic 🤯
* first i took the array input then traversed thru the array and on every same array element upadted a variable count ....if the count exceeds n/2 that means 
it satisifies the given question criteria and then as sonn as the criterion is met i print out the number and stop other executions using break
* [3,2,3]  [1,2,2,2,5]
* libraray used :- <iostream> c++ library

# Time Complexity and Space Complexity
```cpp


 Time Complexity -> O(n^2)
 Space Complexity -> O(n)

```
