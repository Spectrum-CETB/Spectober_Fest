1.Remove loop in Linked List
Given a linked list of N nodes such that it may contain a loop.

A loop here means that the last node of the link list is connected to the node at position X(1-based index). If the link list does not have any loop, X=0.

Remove the loop from the linked list, if it is present, i.e. unlink the last node which is forming the loop.

Problem Explanation:

Your task is to complete the function removeLoop() which takes the head of the linked list as the input parameter. Simply remove the loop in the list (if present) without disconnecting any nodes from the list.


Time Complexity:
Time complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary space: O(1)

2.Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 

Problem Explanation:

The task is to complete the function trappingWater() which takes arr[] and N as input parameters and returns the total amount of water that can be trapped.

Time Complexity:
Time complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary space: O(N)
