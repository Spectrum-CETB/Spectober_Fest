1.K-th element of two sorted Arrays

Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. The task is to find the element that would be at the kâ€™th position of the final sorted array.

Problem Explanation:
Your task is to complete the function kthElement() which takes the arrays arr1[], arr2[], its size N and M respectively and an integer K as inputs and returns the element at the Kth position.

Time Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(Log(N) + Log(M))
Auxiliary Space: O(Log (N))

2. Majority Element

Given an array A of N elements. Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array A of size N is an element that appears more than N/2 times in the array.
 
Problem Explanation:
The task is to complete the function majorityElement() which returns the majority element in the array. If no majority exists, return -1.

Time Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
