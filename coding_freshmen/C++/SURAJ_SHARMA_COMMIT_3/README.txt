1.Find All Four Sum Numbers
Given an array of integers and another number. Find all the unique quadruple from the given array that sums up to the given number.

Problem Explanation:
 Your task is to complete the function fourSum() which takes the array arr[] and the integer k as its input and returns an array containing all the quadruples in a lexicographical manner. Also note that all the quadruples should be internally sorted, ie for any quadruple [q1, q2, q3, q4] the following should follow: q1 <= q2 <= q3 <= q4.  (In the output each quadruple is separate by $. The printing is done by the driver's code)

Time Complexity:
Time complexity: O(N^3)
Auxiliary space: O(N^2)

2.Given a matrix of size r*c. Traverse the matrix in spiral form.

Problem Explanation:
Complete the function spirallyTraverse() that takes matrix, r and c as input parameters and returns a list of integers denoting the spiral traversal of matrix. 

Time Complexity:
Time complexity: O(r*c)
Auxiliary space: O(r*c)
