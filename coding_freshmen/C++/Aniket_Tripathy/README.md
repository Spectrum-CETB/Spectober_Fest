# Problem Title: PRODUCT_FINDER
  Find the product of the elements of the array except the given pivot element

# Problem Explanation ðŸš€
We need to find the product of all elements of the array while skipping the pivot element 

# Intuition and LogicðŸ§ 
*  Assuming that all the elements in the array are unique we can simply calculate the products of all the elements in a prod variable, and when we encounter the pivot element we can simply use the continue; statememt to skip that element.

# Time Complexity and Space Complexity
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(1)
