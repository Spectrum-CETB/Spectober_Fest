# 1. Problem Title: Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

# Problem Explanation

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# Logic and Intuition

- Here the logic i applied is to sort both the striings and compare both strings.

# Time Complexity and Space Complexity
* Time Complexity: O(n logn)
* Space Complexity: O(1)
