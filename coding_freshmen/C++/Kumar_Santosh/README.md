# 1. Problem Title: Maximum Sum
  Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
  (A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.)

# Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Here, the user gives input for n-size array and the elements for the array .
Then, we have to print out maximum sum possible from adding elements of contiguous subarray. 

# Logic and Intuition ðŸ§ 
* Here, the basic approach I have applied is also known as Kedane's Algorithm in which I have taken two variables MAXsum
  which stores the maximum sum of subarray found so far and second variable "sum" which stores summation of array elements into it as it 
  iterates through the array.
* Everytime there is a positive-sum value in "sum" compare it with "MAXsum" and update "MAXsum" if it is greater than "MAXsum" .
* And if there is a negative-sum value(<0) in "sum" and then it changes the value into 0.

* TESTCASES:- 
  1) [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] --> 6
  2) [1,2,3,4,-7,4,8] --> 15

# 1. Problem Title: SORT_01
  You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order.
  Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array [Basically you have to sort the array].

# Problem Explanation ðŸš€
  Here the user provide an array consist of 0s ans 1s only.
  According to the problem we have to put 0s to left side and 1s to the right side of that array. 

# Logic and Intuition ðŸ§ 
* Here, the approach is to provide two cariables pointing towards the extreme opposite ends.
  And then traverse the array from both the sides, keep on traversing from left while there is 0s at it.
  or from right while there is 1s at it.
* If after one by one traversing, if l-variable is smaller than r-variable then exchange the values.

** Probably the best approach here would have been to sort the given array with MERGE sort.

* TESTCASES:- 
  1) [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  --> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  2) [ 0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]  --> [ 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
