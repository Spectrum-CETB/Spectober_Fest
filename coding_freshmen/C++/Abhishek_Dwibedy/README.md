# 1.Title of the Problem:Sort_array

You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order.

# Problem Explanation ðŸš€

Basically , we have to sort the input array in terms of 0 and 1 in ascending order.

# Your logic ðŸ¤¯

- simply we have to sorting the array in ascending order.

# Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity -> O(n)
Space Complexity -> O(1)



# 2. Problem Title: MAXIMUM_SUM

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

# Problem Explanation

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

# Logic and Intuition

- Here the logic that i applied is to add the numbers from starting index, if it's found greater than the sum then this value will be assigned to the sum, if the addition value become negative, then it's made 0.
# Time Complexity and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
