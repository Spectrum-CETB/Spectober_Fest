# SORT_1

You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order.

## Problem Explanation

Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array [Basically you have to sort the array].

## My Logic

Bubble sort starts with very first two elements, comparing them to check which one is greater. Algorithm compares the first two elements and swaps during second iteration it follows the same process.


## Test cases

1. Input array   =  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] 

Output array =  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] 
   
   
<!-- I don't know how to calculate time and space complexity-->
